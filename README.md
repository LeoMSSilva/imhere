# :house: About

This project was developed in **typescript** language, using **react native** and **expo** frameworks.

I used **javascript** and **json** languages ​​as secondary languages, just for the configuration files.

I used the **commitlint**, **@commitlint/config-conventional**, **commitizen** and **cz-conventional-changelog** libraries to keep the patterns in the commits, the **prettier**, **@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports** and **eslint** (*config*: **prettier**, **@react-native-community**; *plugins*: **prettier**, **@typescript-eslint**, **@react-native-community**; *parser*: **@typescript-eslint**) libraries to maintain formatting standards, also helping to remove errors in the code, and the **husky**, **lint-staged** libraries to automate tasks before committing new code to ensure that the code is formatted and without errors.

I used the **babel plugin module resolver** library to define relative paths.

This project is about a list of attendees for an event.

You can access the project through the qr code published at **[expo](https://expo.dev/@leomssilva/imhere)**.
